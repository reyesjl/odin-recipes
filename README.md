## Self Reflection
I decided on simple colors with a minimal theme. Square images and Japanese fonts. 
Navigation is accessible via home page layout and a back button. All in all I am 
pretty happy with how it turned out. I made it mobile friendly as well. Using bare css.
Simple & clean aesthetic make for useful design.
